## 💡 My Review

🚀 **My First Project – A Learning Experience!**

This was my first big project, and I gave it my best shot! Since I didn’t use APIs, core JavaScript frameworks, or external JS tools, I had to build everything from scratch, which was a fantastic learning experience. While some areas could be improved with optimizations and advanced tools, I’m proud of what I achieved. **The journey has just begun!** 💪🔥

Would love to hear feedback and suggestions! 😊
